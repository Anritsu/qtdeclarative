\title qmllint
\brief A tool for verifying the syntax of QML files and warning about
anti-patterns.

\e qmllint is a tool shipped with Qt, that verifies the syntatic validity of
QML files.
It also warns about some QML anti-patterns. If you want to disable a specific
warning type, you can find the appropriate flag for doing so by passing
\c{--help} on the command line.

By default, some issues will result in warnings that will be printed and result
in a non-zero exit code.
Minor issues however (such as unused imports) are just informational messages
by default and will not affect the exit code.
qmllint is very configurable and allows for disabling warnings or changing how
they are treated.
Users may freely turn any issue into a warning, informational message, or
disable them outright.

qmllint warns about:
\list
  \li Unqualified accesses of properties.
  \li Usage of signal handlers without a matching signal.
  \li Usage of with statements in QML.
  \li Unused imports.
  \li Deprecated components and properties.
  \li And many other things.
\endlist

\note In order for qmllint to work properly, it requires type information.
That information is provided by QML modules in the import paths.
The current directory, as well as the import paths for Qt's built-in types,
are used as import paths by default.
To add more import paths not included in the default,
add them via the \c{-I} flag.

To get an overview and explanation of all available command line options, run \c{qmllint --help}.

\section2 Settings

In addition to passing command-line options, you can also
configure qmllint via a settings file.
The command line \c{--write-defaults} will generate one for you.

Setting files are named \c{.qmllint.ini} and look like this:

\quotefile qmllint/config.ini

Warning levels may be set to \c{info}, \c{warning} or \c{disable} just as with
command line options.

qmllint will automatically look for a settings file at the location of the qml
file that is being linted.
It also looks through all parent directories to find this file and
automatically applies the settings therein. You can disable this behavior by
using \c{--ignore-settings}.
You may always override these defaults by specifying command line parameters
that take precedence over the warning levels in settings.

\section2 Scripting

qmllint can output JSON via the \c{--json} option which will return valid JSON
with warning messages, file and line location of warnings, and their severity
level.
This can be used to more easily integrate qmllint in your pre-commit hooks or
CI testing.
